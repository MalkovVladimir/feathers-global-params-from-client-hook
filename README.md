# feathers-global-params-from-client-hook
 Alternative of paramsFromClient hook for app.hook.ts

This is "soft" aletrnative of paramsFromClient hook (https://hooks-common.feathersjs.com/hooks.html#paramsfromclient).
When you use paramsFromClient in app.hook, it fully removes $client property (which contains all params),
so we loose possibility to use params in service's hooks.

For example:
query: { name: 'Ivan', $client: { schema: 'pre-seed' } }
app.hooks: paramsFromClient('disableParanoid') // it whitelist only "disableParanoid" param and remove all others ($client removed)
users.hooks: paramsFromClient('schema') // no effect, we will never get schema param, if use paramsFromClient in app.hook
